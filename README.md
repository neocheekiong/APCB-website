# APCB-website
This is a place for Addictions Therapists to submit their applications to be certified as an addictions therapist. This includes the upload of documentation for the registrar to review

This website will also list certified members for the public to examine and verify.

A registrar will be able to view pending applications to verify and approve the applicants' fitness to practice addictions therapy.
